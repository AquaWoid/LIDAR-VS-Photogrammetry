# LIDAR-VS-Photogrammetry

The included .blend file includes all 3 versions of the 6 models scanned for the Digital Museology class.
Since github's LFS system seems to be bugged and doesn't want me to upload my large file i had to upload it to google drive and will just include the link here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kd0VJRYSfs6J2aAzd67-vgiy6i3pX_Zr/view?usp=sharing
